# Important Notice
SAP has decided to stop the maintenance of this open source project and hence it'll soon be sunsetted and archived. 

Going forward, please look at [SAP Cloud Platform Appliation Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap) as the recommended approach to develop cloud applications with SAP Cloud Platform. 


SAP Cloud Platform Samples - enterprise granny
========

<p align="center">
  <img src="/doc/ensw_granny_logo_web.png" width="25%">
</p>

Enterprise Granny is a sample application used to demonstrate how-to develop great cloud applications with the SAP Cloud Platform. Step by step we will enhance this simple demo app and make it _enterprise-ready_ by using open source software and by leveraging some of the capabilities of the platform.

**Note:** The initial source code is a fork of the original [Granny's Addressbook](https://github.com/osintegrators/JavaSpringGranny) application provided by Open Software Integrators. 

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny/archive/master.zip).

With the introduction of the 2.x branch (which is now the new master branch) the application has been refactored into three modules:

+ a shared `enterprise-granny-core` module, which contains the domain model and the API,
+ a (micro-) service (provider) called `enterprise-granny-service` and
+ an exemplary client application called `enterprise-granny-client` 

The later two are both web applications (packaged as WAR files by default) and hence, need to be deployed separately. As the client uses the REST API of the service (provider) one needs to specify the endpoint URL pointing to the API. This is done as described below:

+ _SAP HANA Cloud Platform (NEO):_ Define an HTTP destination with the name `Addressbook-Service`. The client app comes with an example, which can be found here: [destination.properties](enterprise-granny-client/src/main/resources/destinations/destination.properties)
+ _Cloud Foundry:_ Define a user-defined environment variable with the name `ADDRESSBOOK_SERVICE` and the value of the URI, as shown below: 

```
ADDRESSBOOK_SERVICE=https://enterprise-granny-service.cfapps.neo.ondemand.com/api/v1
```

Please also remember to adjust the declared services within the [`manifest.yml`](enterprise-granny-client/manifest.yml) file as required for your runtime environment! 

> **NOTE:** If you intend to deploy this application to a Cloud Foundry landscape provided by SAP or its partners in order to leverage the capabilities of the SAP HANA database platform you need to manually provide the HANA JDBC driver (`ngdbc.jar`) within the [`WEB-INF/lib`](enterprise-granny-service/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib) folder. 

> **NOTE:** Please note that the application does not run on the Java EE 6 Web profile (2.x) runtime on SAP Cloud Platform due to class loading conflicts with the out-dated javax.validation version used by this runtime!

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP Cloud Platform - Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
